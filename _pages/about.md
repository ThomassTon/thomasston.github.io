I am completing my Masterâ€™s degree in Autonomous Systems and Robotics at TU Darmstadt, where I have successfully defended my thesis on motion planning for dual-arm robots.

My research interests include motion planning, control, and learning for robotic manipulation and navigation.
I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position to further develop intelligent and adaptive robot behaviors.

Beyond research, I am passionate about Formula 1 and enjoy cycling.
